I was in their community early on, like 2013 or so, and the content they put out then was truly excellent. A paywall was reasonable really; the classes were well researched and informative and I am sure their operation is quite expensive.<p>But over time they became a bit less focused on interesting stuff and more focused on stuff that would play to social media. Their candy class was a hallmark - very informative, very interesting, and several great recipes that you typically wouldn\u2019t find anywhere else. Like they have a starburst clone recipe that honestly most sites wouldn\u2019t bother with because it\u2019s unbelievably labor intensive. But I made it and it was extremely satisfying<p>If you go on their YouTube and go back a decade you can see the change in content. Their current stuff is basically cloning Epicurious but occasionally shilling really expensive brevile appliances that have very short warranties despite being 5x the cost of comparable products.", "time": 1740558473, "type": "comment"}
