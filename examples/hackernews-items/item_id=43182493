Americans aren\u2019t going to die en masse over some random island in the pacific.<p>This is such a funny comment because it\u2019s both right and oh so wrong.<p>Yes, the U.S. was likely never gonna send troops to fight in Taiwan (although it has sent troops to fight in Korea, so it\u2019s not as much of a stretch as you claim).<p>But the bluff worked because the U.S.\u2019s promises held value. To the point that the U.S. didn\u2019t explicitly say they would defend Taiwan against China, but China was avoiding confrontation with Taiwan simply to prevent the U.S. from saying they would do that.<p>Of course, Donald Trump damaged that significantly in his first term and has torn that to shreds in his second term.<p>With Trump\u2019s nakedly transparent and quod pro quo based foreign affairs, it\u2019s hard to remember how much soft power value the U.S. had built up over decades where it could achieve what it wanted without even saying anything, which has basically been destroyed over about a decade.", "time": 1740565846, "type": "comment"}
