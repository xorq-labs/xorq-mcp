People when asked about range answer that way <i>because they&#x27;re comparing to what they already have</i> and have to make up an answer to justify their decisions, not because of need.<p>&gt; You must just accept that others value different things.<p>And you must accept that your values does not equal the actual needs of the general population, which can be quite easily assessed based on normal worklife patterns.<p>I&#x27;m sure we can agree that any vehicle is objectively best if it is optimized for your actual needs, and that the more often it fit your need the better. This makes it quite simple: Does your daily driving equal roadtrips, yes or no?<p>If not, <i>you</i> will get an objectively better experience (better handling, less noise, less energy&#x2F;fuel cost, less tire wear, faster charging to full) while simultaneously saving your bank account and the environment. And no, a dialy driver doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;renault zoe&quot;, it just means &quot;smaller and lighter battery&quot;.<p>If you drive 1 roadtrip per year or less, it makes sense to rent the car for roadtrip to get the best of both worlds: the best roadtrip machine and the best daily driver, which are mutually exclusive requirements. The roadtrip vehicle might be a large, comfortable ICE car with below average fuel economy and plenty of space - maybe even pulling a camping wagon depending on what you want to do on roadtrips.<p>If you drive 2+ roadtrips per year, maybe it starts to make sense to buy a roadtrip-specific secondary vehicle. If you drive much more than that (e.g., every weekend, or daily work involves multi-hour driving), then it starts to make sense financially to compromise and use a roadtrip vehicle for daily driving.", "time": 1740568363, "type": "comment"}
