I used WSL to access those files under Windows, and generated the same on Linux. You can see that behavior differs on the same file names:<p>1. On Windows, accessed by WSL<p>2. On Linux (WSL), using UTF-8 locale<p>3. On Linux (WSL), using POSIX locale<p>The difference is weird for me as a user. I&#x27;d like to know about the decisions made behind these.
