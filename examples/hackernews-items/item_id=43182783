That&#x27;s why WebAssembly is being so widely implemented.<p>Java was on a path to do what WebAssembly is doing now, back in the &#x27;90s. Every machine had a JRE installed, every browser could run Java applets. But Java is so slow (and its sandboxing design so poor) that the world gave up on Java being able to deliver &quot;compile once run anywhere&quot;.<p>If you want to take a second crack at Sun&#x27;s vision, then you can go write your own embedded JVM and try to convince people to write an LLVM backend for it. The rest of us gave up on that idea when applets were removed from browsers for being a security risk.", "time": 1740570109, "type": "comment"}
