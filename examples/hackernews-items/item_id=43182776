He wants to be the public face of a company, he can&#x27;t then selectively choose to shield said company from his antics when they backfire.<p>Nothing stopped Elon from divesting himself of his commercial holdings and announce that he wants to enter politics. Then I, and many others, would have no qualms about buying Tesla cars.<p>Obviously, doing so would&#x27;ve required a degree of personal integrity and humility, which he seems to be lacking.", "time": 1740570069, "type": "comment"}
