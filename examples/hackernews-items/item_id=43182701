It is not a place to publish results (in the sense that it is the final place for a paper&#x27;s results) and there should be no general expectation that anything there has been reviewed.  The purpose is to <i>be</i> lightly moderated for the purposes of circulating papers quickly for things like feedback <i>before</i> peer review and to have a reference on when results were completed (not completed the publication process, which is different) for the sake of establishing chronology.<p>If you were reading papers in a serious way you should have already been tipped off by the fact that references in any credibly reviewed paper will rarely and only in exceptional circumstances cite an arxiv paper for these reasons.<p>If you were using it as a sole place to do research you have made a grave mistake and you should educate yourself on where credible work is published for whatever your area of interest is.  Those typically cost exploitative amounts of money and is a separate problem, but isn&#x27;t something you can just wish away because you stumbled on arxiv without understanding what it is.", "time": 1740569109, "type": "comment"}
