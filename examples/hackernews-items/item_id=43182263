Distance between you and anything would increase to infinity. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if it&#x27;s closer to the black hole from you or further away. I wonder if it even occurs with things that fall into the black hole with you.<p>2) You&#x27;d see time pass infinitely fast. I&#x27;d say &quot;behind you&quot;, but not really of course: anything already fallen in you wouldn&#x27;t see, and you wouldn&#x27;t see anything exactly at the same position as you do, so anything you can see would see time pass infinitely fast. You&#x27;d be &quot;transported to the end of time&quot;.<p>3) You&#x27;d see the whole universe compress into a single point (like in a lens I presume)<p>I wonder if this wouldn&#x27;t present problems. The whole point of Hawking radiation is that the black hole will stretch out the wave function of light, in both ways (it &quot;transports energy&quot; from the virtual photon falling in to the particle escaping. The particle falling in loses energy, and keeps losing energy forever, while the particle escaping gains energy and since gravity has infinite range, it also keeps gaining energy forever, it&#x27;s just that the amount decreases exponentially, never quite reaching zero. The particles never quite become real particles, however virtual particles do interact, so I&#x27;m not quite sure what makes them virtual, aside from their origin). Wouldn&#x27;t it stretch out the wave function of any particle? And if you stretch out the wave function of a particle, you reduce it&#x27;s energy. If you stretch it out infinitely you reduce it&#x27;s energy, in the limit (but the limit is the event horizon), to zero. And the particles themselves aren&#x27;t zero size: they would &quot;see&quot; this happen. Even the famous &quot;point-particle&quot; that is the electron has a wave function that occupies a portion of space (in fact, it occupies a surprisingly big volume)<p>So the mass of black holes could be in these frozen particles being teleported to the end of time, while losing energy.", "time": 1740563059, "type": "comment"}
