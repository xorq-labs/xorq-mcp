I haven&#x27;t written in go yet but whenever there are brackets I like for them to be vertically aligned with each other like Allman (even in Python!).<p>Agreeing with sibling comment too that K&amp;R can be ok.. seems like K&amp;R function declarations have Allman-like vertically-aligned brackets, but why not make that consistent for blocks inside the function too? 1TBS goes in the opposite direction, so not heaps of a fan of that.<p>I am a big fan of whitespace in code though, running afoul of various style-guides at times (like PEP8) because of the desire to put space between things to make things clearer.<p>I reckon code is already a very-condensed form of information, so it can help to make it easier to distinguish the meaningfully-different pieces by having some space around them. I know this is not everyone&#x27;s jam, but that&#x27;s what I like when reading code.", "time": 1740562249, "type": "comment"}
