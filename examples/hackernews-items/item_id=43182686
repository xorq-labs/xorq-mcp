Essentially it takes the FFT of the input embeddings, multiplies it elementwise with weights that are gotten from the input embeddings using an MLP (plus a constant (but learnable) bias) and then runs it through an activation function and finally takes the inverse FFT.<p>The &quot;frequencies&quot; are probably something quite abstract. FFT is often used in ways where there aren&#x27;t really clear frequency interpretation. The use is due to convenient mathematical properties (e.g. the convolution theorem).<p>Rather amazing if this really works well. Very elegant.", "time": 1740568865, "type": "comment"}
