A &quot;review website&quot; which is all that, but with fake reviews that promote one brand over the others\u2026 a chain of such websites that link to each other to boost PageRank scores\u2026 which are then cross-linked with a huge number of social media bots\u2026<p>Will lead to a lot of people who think they&#x27;re making an informed choice, but who were lied to about everything from their cornflakes to their president.<p>* Tautologically, when it&#x27;s not &quot;abuse&quot;, SEO is only helping the search engine find the real content.
