You can set it up in github actions pretty easily.<p>Good point. My experience is that super-long test runs also have dependencies that interfere with parallelization, but that might just be the projects I&#x27;ve worked on.<p>&gt; If a feature that predicted which tests to run were drop in Id say it was a no brainer too, but there is no tooling for it yet so it would have to be built from scratch.<p>There is! I wrote one for Python (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getspdr.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getspdr.dev</a>)! If you just care about local runs, there&#x27;s also the pytest-testmon plugin. Fos Js, both Vitest and Jest have settings to enable it. It&#x27;s definitely out there!", "time": 1740567685, "type": "comment"}
