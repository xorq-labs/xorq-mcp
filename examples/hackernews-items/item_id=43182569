Those are simply bags of bytes, the encoding only matters for displaying them, and isn&#x27;t interpreted internally. ls failing to access the .exe is clearly a WSL filesystem issue and not a Linux &#x2F; ls issue. You also can&#x27;t set a UTF-16 locale because that&#x27;s not what a locale is. UTF-16&#x2F;32 vs SBCS and UTF-8 is the wide&#x2F;narrow character distinction, which is a whole separate thing, different ABIs, different APIs.", "time": 1740566782, "type": "comment"}
