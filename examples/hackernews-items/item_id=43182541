She only said the words I quoted and left, while I stayed petrified after my first xenophobic encounter in Germany. Only when she was far away I reacted and yelled at her an argentinian insult that has no translation, out of frustration and fear. So typical for a lot of Germans and Argentinians to fake being demented when you tell them there is a racism or xenophobic problem. &quot;surely you misremember&quot;, &quot;surely that was not all the dialogue&quot;, &quot;I never have seen a racist in my whole life&quot; (ok that last one actually is hyperbolic).<p>Of course the mask itself was not FFP2 in an official manner, that is a fact today and at that time. That lady had no idea and should have explained to me how important it is for people in Germany to follow the law, no matter what. Instead, she reacted like that. Of course I was in the wrong, and quickly procured myself an FFP2 mask as soon as I could.<p>You know why I&#x27;m leaving Germany?<p>Because I could not adapt to the culture.\nI could not learn the language.<p>Why Ireland? Because I have family there, because I speak their language, because people don&#x27;t stare at me 24&#x2F;7 on public transport, because the border police are not mini-dictators that when educated about their own laws scream at you WELCOME TO GERMANY while angrily smashing your Argentinian passport into the small table at the booth. (Now that I am a Polish citizen, I can avoid interacting with those mini dictators. Isn&#x27;t that what I am supossed to do? Not stay in a country I could not adapt to? I gave it a few years, but family members dying 1000&#x27;s of kilometers away from you take a toll.<p>What is YOUR problem, dude? Any more comments on how should I live my life?<p>Stop being like that, please... Engage in some empathy. Put yourself in someone else&#x27;s shoes for once.", "time": 1740566363, "type": "comment"}
