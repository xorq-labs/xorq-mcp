Disney, Comcast, Fox, or Bezos don\u2019t want them.<p>Sources will worry about confidentiality. If a journo confirms something is off the record, it\u2019s off the record. No buts. This is treated very seriously: it ruins the entire publication\u2019s reputation and ability to talk to sources.<p>If a naive journos tries, it\u2019ll be killed by their editor, if not the editor-in-chief, probably under the veneer of legal and&#x2F;or ethical grounds.<p>Of course, a journo can talk to someone else who chooses to disclose whatever, be protected, etc, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. But the oldest adage in journalism is: \u201cdon\u2019t be the story\u201d.<p>It\u2019s probably one of the best professions, tbh, as paradoxical as it sounds.<p>Remember that the journalism industry, as a whole, is not the idealised dream you think it is.", "time": 1740567433, "type": "comment"}
