If you leave open <i>any</i> possibility of a CA delaying or refusing revocation because of some form of &quot;it&#x27;s an administrative issue, it isn&#x27;t that serious anyways&quot;, every incident will inevitably result in a weeks-long discussion about the real impact of the incident and whether this one is &quot;serious enough&quot; to require immediate action.<p>In the past CAs have been more than happy to lie and downplay incidents, because they <i>know</i> their customers don&#x27;t like revocations and are going to consider switching to a competitor. Maybe not a big deal in practice for a technicality, but it does mean that CAs can not be trusted to <i>always</i> be truthful - and that in turn extends to serious incidents. This is obviously really bad for the web PKI as a whole, so the rule is that <i>any</i> violation of the rules, no matter how small or nitpicky, must be treated as if it were a serious security incident. Don&#x27;t agree with the rules or think the rule is interpreted the wrong way? File a report <i>afterwards</i> to review the rules.<p>The entire business of a CA is to be a trusted third party. If you can&#x27;t be trusted to <i>always</i> follow the rules <i>exactly to the letter</i>, you shouldn&#x27;t be a CA. Behaving predictably is more important than being right about some technical minutiae regarding the security impact of some incident.", "time": 1740566176, "type": "comment"}
