I can conceivably imagine those two teams wanting to split off their individual parts of the functionality to be separate.<p>With any sort of system, when there are multiple components involved, having clear ownership and being able to iterate quickly can be pretty good - for example, if there&#x27;s a system that handles the management of all sorts of binary data (file uploads, metadata storage for those) then having one team be responsible for it but other teams just using it can be a good setup.<p>I would argue that you don&#x27;t always need to chop up your domain into microservices (depending on the size of your domain), but definitely look into doing that across various technological boundaries (a team for your web API, your auth, scheduled processes and messaging, handling object storage etc.). If you do that too much, though, it&#x27;s going to become a bit of a mess of granularity.", "time": 1740558353, "type": "comment"}
