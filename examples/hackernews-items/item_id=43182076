First, you did not read the article and did not see the footnote that these are valid in Linux as well.<p>Second, your comment shows you are lacking the knowledge on Linux as well. In Linux, as I have written in the foot note, accepts anything but 0x00 (null) and 0x2F (\u201c&#x2F;\u201d). Other than that, all characters are valid paths. If you consider these a problem, I&#x27;d like to remind that the 2048 surrogate pairs is a really small subset of unrenderable combinations allowed in Linux.<p>Anyone are free to have their opinions but at least, before making bold claims, please do your due diligence.", "time": 1740560804, "type": "comment"}
