To fixate on that is to deny the reality that trans people don&#x27;t necessarily fit into the gender binary (and at the same time many do). Our systems are structured by gender binaries and so accommodations need to be made for those who don&#x27;t fit perfectly (which also helps cis women who do not present as traditionally feminine).<p>I cannot speak to prison policies that have created conditions for the attacks you have mentioned, but a blanket policy putting trans women in men&#x27;s prisons is putting their lives at risk, while a case-by-case policy is not necessarily putting cis women&#x27;s lives at risk if it is implemented well.<p>The notion that trans women are inherently dangerous to cis women, which is the conclusion you seem to be arriving at because you are thinking of trans women as men, is a false notion.<p>Cis men are the greatest danger to cis women. If the amount of attention being placed on trans women were instead being placed on that fact, maybe cis women would actually be safer.<p>Trans people exist and always have. Right now we are being demonized because we are an easy target. And when folks like you buy into that, you are doing the demonizing work for the people who are controlling through division. Trans people are not a problem to be solved. We&#x27;re just fighting to keep our rights from being taken away.", "time": 1740561548, "type": "comment"}
