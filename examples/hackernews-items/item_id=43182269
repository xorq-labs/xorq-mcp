Holy shit it&#x27;s painful. I regret doing it but it became a battle I refused to surrender.<p>It&#x27;s way harder than I expected because of the combination of the ambiguity of * and ** in multi-symbol runs which support infinite nesting even of the same type of emphasis. A given delimiter run could be many different permutations of plain text `*`, `em` and `strong` depending on context of other delimiter runs that might open and close sections along side other context like punctuation, intraword-ness, flanking and whether sums of runs can be be factored by three!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spec.commonmark.org&#x2F;0.31.2&#x2F;#emphasis-and-strong-emphasis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spec.commonmark.org&#x2F;0.31.2&#x2F;#emphasis-and-strong-emph...</a><p>I never expected &quot;**&quot; could be nested emphasis instead of bold so interpretation requires multiple passes to break down delimiter runs and match them up e.g.<p><pre><code>    ***this* and that* -&gt; *&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and that &lt;&#x2F;em&gt;</code></pre>", "time": 1740563159, "type": "comment"}
