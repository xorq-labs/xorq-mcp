He pulled the (originally apache 2) source offline, then started threatening to sue people for hosting alternative versions, including them in other IDEs, etc. Genuine lunatic.<p>Out of an abundance of precaution, I&#x27;ve taken the following action on my fork:<p>1. I have the VS Code team auditing it as we speak, and I&#x27;ve given them full permission to immediately pull it from the marketplace &amp; force uninstall it from users if they find ANYTHING malicious.<p>2. I have audited the code base thoroughly (nothing seemed malicious)<p>3. I have removed ALL code related to changelogs, analytics, Open Collective and html rendering.<p>The only thing that seemed slightly concerning was the html + sanity loader for changelogs, so I gutted it entirely. Two PRs removed almost all the deps and over 7,000loc (mostly package-lock)<p>Repo is here if anyone else would like to audit <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;t3dotgg&#x2F;vsc-material-but-i-wont-sue-you\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;t3dotgg&#x2F;vsc-material-but-i-wont-sue-you</a>", "time": 1740561811, "type": "comment"}
