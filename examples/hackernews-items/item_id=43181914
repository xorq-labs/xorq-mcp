It might have screened in schools but that was not it&#x27;s primary purpose. But, carried into the modern era I am pretty sure historians would mutter about the many solecisms. None the less it was better than AI.<p>Much of the history about roman times is under reconsideration in the light of things like new digs in Pompeii. People projected current social values onto what they found, DNA analysis now permits much stronger indications of filiality or patriality of the remains. &quot;oh, this is a mother protecting her child&quot; can turn out to be a male, and an un-related child female. How this is re-interpreted is not always clear.<p>Likewise metallurgy can change our view of history. The huntarian museum in Glasgow University has 4 coins, held by past antiquarians and historians to be crude forgeries. They turn out from metallurgy to be real, and futhermore confirm an emperor held for a very long time to be speculative, and undocumented. We now have structural evidence of his existence.<p>AI tiktoks aren&#x27;t currently helping here. They aren&#x27;t providing visuals which carry the history forward, they just project classicly bad tropes. Sure, they&#x27;re entertaining. So is &quot;gladiator&quot; but historians had enough on their plate there.", "time": 1740558949, "type": "comment"}
