That allows it to be accessible for 85-90% of the world&#x27;s population.<p>It cost me about $50. It saved me months of work on a &quot;labor of love&quot; project and allowed me to add lots of quality of life features in a single day that I just never would have gotten to otherwise.<p>That&#x27;s an enormous value for me.", "time": 1740570577, "type": "comment"}
