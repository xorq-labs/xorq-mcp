Regarding your anecdote - do you know if that woman was clear minded? Do you know if she hadn&#x27;t lost a family member to COVID the day before? This highlights the fundamental problem with anecdotal evidence: we can talk in circles, and none of it establishes a meaningful point.<p>&gt; Stop being like that, please... Engage in some empathy. Put yourself in someone else&#x27;s shoes for once.<p>You&#x27;re right about one thing: I struggle to show empathy for someone who complains about racism while exhibiting racist behavior themselves.", "time": 1740567980, "type": "comment"}
