A more surprising (i.e. less likely) result carries more information. In the informational theory sense. A word with broad scope will be more used, thus be more frequent in text, and thus, carry less information.<p>&gt; To my understanding, you suggested using the term &quot;THE text format on Linux&quot; as a replacement for &quot;machine-readable&quot; (as it is currently used). My objection was that those concepts are not the same and, in fact, binary files tend to be machine-readable moreso than text files.<p>Ok, you have a point there.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the author ever compared binary machine only readable formats, either. All the machine-readable formats that he looked into admin were human-readable too.<p>&gt; Many things (including, say, an 8-bit image) can be rendered as bytes.<p>Sorry, I meant to say UTF8&#x2F;UTF16&#x2F;ASCII etc. Probably was messing around with UTF8 -&gt; bytes conversion around that time.", "time": 1740568367, "type": "comment"}
