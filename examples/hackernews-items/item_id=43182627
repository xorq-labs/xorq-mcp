Unless you count selling food and raw material as war profiteering.<p>Yes I do, Brazil was selling food and raw materials to both sides while staying out of the war just like Sweden. The main difference is that Brazil moved out of its neutral position several years before the end of the war, but that only happened because of US direct support. Sweden probably got similar deals from the US but didn&#x27;t want to risk getting invaded like Norway was.<p>&gt; Also, all of this is extensively covered by Brazilian schools. I have no idea what accusation you have of downplaying stuff.<p>Like I mentioned, I was taught this in high school, but a lot of Brazilian people I mention this fact to doesn&#x27;t seem to know about it. This is anecdotal though.", "time": 1740567773, "type": "comment"}
