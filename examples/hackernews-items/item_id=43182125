Which is nearly always illegal, but could be considered a form of &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; especially if done ethically - e.g. removing sensitive data or leaking only aggregates of the data. Either from outside, or by a whistle-blower.<p>I&#x27;m not saying &quot;hack the government!&quot;. But I am arguing that the pressure of &quot;getting hacked&quot; is like the pressure of protests, blockades, occupying facilities etc, all of which civil disobedience, and often simply illegal too. All are tools in the belts of civilians to keep a government in check. Extracting information that a government is not willing to give but that would benefit the governed, should IMO often be considered such a tool as well.", "time": 1740561422, "type": "comment"}
