Even sex is not a binary when you consider that chromosomes beyond XX&#x2F;XY exist and that the expression of chromosomes does not necessarily result in a genital configuration you might expect (not to mention the wide variety of configurations within the binary).<p>Calling it &quot;biological reality&quot; is a massive oversimplification of biology that is used to stir unease towards trans people. Trans people are not beating up [cis] women in sports. This is another story to stir up fear and hatred, and you&#x27;re just repeating it thoughtlessly.<p>Most of what you&#x27;re seeing politically is defending a vulnerable group from unwarranted attacks by a powerful political party backed by moneyed interests sowing division as a distraction from the real problems. If the right weren&#x27;t so focused on taking away trans people&#x27;s rights to bodily autonomy and existence, you wouldn&#x27;t be hearing about us so much.<p>I am going to repeat some of what I replied to someone else...<p>Birth sex is not useful when talking about trans people, who may be on hormone replacement therapy or have had gender affirming surgeries. To fixate on that is to deny the reality that trans people don&#x27;t necessarily fit into the gender binary (and at the same time many do). Our systems are structured by gender binaries and so accommodations need to be made for those who don&#x27;t fit perfectly (which also helps cis women who do not present as traditionally feminine).<p>The notion that trans women are inherently dangerous to cis women, which is the conclusion you seem to be arriving at because you are thinking of trans women as men, is a false notion.<p>Cis men are the greatest danger to cis women. If the amount of attention being placed on trans women were instead being placed on that fact, maybe cis women would actually be safer.<p>Trans people exist and always have. Right now we are being demonized because we are an easy target. And when folks like you buy into that, you are doing the demonizing work for the people who are controlling through division. Trans people are not a problem to be solved. We&#x27;re just fighting to keep our rights from being taken away.", "time": 1740562261, "type": "comment"}
