They have, IIRC, like, a 40 hour test suite or something so for them it made a massive difference.<p>The only time I got close to that (roughly 14 hours, many years ago) we just hacked it by running random tests constantly to detect regressions and only running the whole suite overnight. It brought release cycles down from bi-yearly to once a week or so so people were happy.<p>If your tests are fully isolated (and they should be for many reasons), parallelization ought to be almost drop in. You can set it up in github actions pretty easily.<p>If a feature that predicted which tests to run were drop in Id say it was a no brainer too, but there is no tooling for it yet so it would have to be built from scratch.", "time": 1740560965, "type": "comment"}
