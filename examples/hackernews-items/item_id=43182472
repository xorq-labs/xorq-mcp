I employ them differently in various contexts - in plain Markdown files and on my blog, for instance.<p>But primarily, I treat them as plaintext files. If I needed to remove frontmatter at some point, it would be a simple script. For any feature specific to a particular Markdown flavor, preprocessing, or system - I expect it to work only as plain text elsewhere.<p>Also, thanks for sharing about TSMU! I was thinking about similar issues\u2014for example, a photo can simultaneously be &quot;from 2022,&quot; &quot;from a conference,&quot; and &quot;emotionally important.&quot; This doesn&#x27;t work well with typical nested filesystems, where we need to decide on a single folder hierarchy rather than allowing us to filter based on need (as we can in SQL).", "time": 1740565646, "type": "comment"}
