Then I tried out the following<p><pre><code>  candidate = chr(0xD800)\n  candidate2 = bytes([0xED, 0xA0, 0x80]).decode(&#x27;utf-8&#x27;, errors=&#x27;surrogatepass&#x27;)\n  print(candidate == candidate2) # True\n</code></pre>\nand it seems that you could just iterate over code points directly with the `chr()` function.", "time": 1740569865, "type": "comment"}
