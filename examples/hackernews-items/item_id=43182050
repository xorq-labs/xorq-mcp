I beleive today the main problem is no longer the amount of human labor needed to feed or clothe, but to have access to those universities&#x2F;labs&#x2F;companies that have the necessary resources to enable meaningful research that humanity values.\nCosts of creating food and clothe have plummeted - this is good from any possible point of view, and clearly shows we do no longer &quot;need&quot; inequlity from these perspectives.\nHowever, access to human institutions does not follow the same democratization and pricefall. In several fields (space, medical and material sciences), advances we yearn for require lots of capital&#x2F;military power. In many fields, innovations are tied to huge amounts of money to be spent (mostly accessible only in one particular capital market of the world).\nBut even in &quot;cheaper&quot; fields (like mathematics, economics etc.) simply being heard requires working in prestiguous universities. And many of those have no choice but to select and hire people based on their previous work or their financial capabilities.\nThus, reinforcing the same stratification as we&#x27;ve seen with food and clothing, and slowing the process of finding the right bright minds to do what they excel at in greater numbers.\nIt&#x27;s quite unlikely we will solve any major part of this social problem before 2086 (or any projected population peak)... People seem to be still stuck in celebrity culture in politics and everywhere.", "time": 1740560520, "type": "comment"}
