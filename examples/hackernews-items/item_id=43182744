Does it treat the input tokens as a sampled waveform?<p>I mean, say I have some text file in ASCII. Do I then just pretend it\u2019s raw wav and do FFT on it? I guess it can give me some useful information (like does it look like any particular natural language or is it just random; sometimes used in encrytion analysis of simple substitution cyphers). It feels surprising that revers FFT can get a coherent output after fiddling with the distribution.", "time": 1740569703, "type": "comment"}
