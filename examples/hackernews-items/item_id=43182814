I&#x27;m 51 now.<p>Instead I&#x27;ve certified as an Auriculotherapist (that&#x27;s fancy speak for ear-acupuncture). I chance discovered auriculotherapy about 10 years ago by its potential to reduce stress by modulating the nervous system. And its been my passion since. The ear is way more than some funny cartilage sticking off your head. Its a complete map of the body with every part treatable via microscopic points on the ear surface. Kind of like a &quot;keyboard&quot; into the bodies &quot;operating system&quot;.<p>So the IT business going batsh!t bonkers was my cue to jump out and start a new healthcare business. I regret nothing and feel that I&#x27;m now actually helping people. And people aren&#x27;t getting less stressed these days.<p>Good luck to all when the genAI slop code needs fixing and there are no experienced dev&#x27;s left.", "time": 1740570483, "type": "comment"}
