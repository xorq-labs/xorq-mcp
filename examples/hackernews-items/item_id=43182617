I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s necessary. Databases can obviously be row-oriented too. Knowing that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> cluster would also be layout information. As could any number of other things.<p>&gt; Notably though that doesn&#x27;t give you any sort of relative or absolute offset. Neither does it have anything to say about, for example, blocks of different types which might be interleaved. Or compression. Or indexes. Or copy on write related garbage collection. Or journaling. Or any number of other things.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to include offsets or any of those other things. File layout information could be as simple as &quot;data should be aligned to a page boundary for performance&quot; or &quot;this field must reserve space for up to 16 characters&quot; or even &quot;data from different records should not be stored in an overlapping manner, to allow fast erasure&quot;... I could go on. And notice the wardrobe layout example doesn&#x27;t have offsets either, but the decision to separate jackets from shirts is absolutely one about layout nonetheless.<p>&gt; But I think it&#x27;s fairly reasonable to say that in typical usage an SQL schema is decidedly not a file layout in a literal sense.<p>It is not <i>complete</i> file layout information. But it certainly can be <i>part</i> of the file layout information.<p>Imagine you had a table with columns name1 VARCHAR(64) and name2 VARCHAR(64) in that order. Now imagine you modified a couple of bytes on the disk, such that you swap the 1 and the 2. You can imagine a database where that would be sufficient to confuse it into thinking the two columns had swapped contents, right? Could you really claim the schema didn&#x27;t contain any file layout information in that scenario, when it certainly affected which bytes are interpreted as belonging to which columns?", "time": 1740567590, "type": "comment"}
