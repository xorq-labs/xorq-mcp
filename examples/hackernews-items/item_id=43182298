Not only that, but you can probably just use any user id and just spam-vote anything by massively impersonating other users, which is worse than the previous option.<p>If that&#x27;s why you want to hide the request, then I have to say you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>On the one hand, it&#x27;s wrong because no matter how you hide that code, I can just open the <i>Network tab</i> in the browser&#x27;s console and see the request anyway. In fact, my browser is so friendly it offers me to &quot;Edit and resend&quot; the request and I don&#x27;t need any coding skills to do that.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s wrong because the problem is not located there, in that code. The problem is located in <i>handcmmt.php</i> and in the way you handle identification. <i>handcmmt.php</i> shouldn&#x27;t need to receive the user id at all.", "time": 1740563493, "type": "comment"}
