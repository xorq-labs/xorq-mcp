Happy to Help observes visitor behavior with client-side encrypted monitoring and uses AI to intervene at critical moments.<p>We actually prototyped this four years ago, but shelved it because the AI wasn&#x27;t capable enough. With recent advancements in LLMs, we&#x27;ve rebuilt it from scratch, and the results have been remarkable - it now handles almost all our customer service and drives significant sales conversions.<p>Technical implementation:\n- Real-time client-side behavior analysis (clicks, scrolls, form interactions, mouse movements) with browser-based encryption\n- Automated RAG construction from your website content - zero manual training required\n- Model-agnostic architecture that works with any LLM (including your own)\n- Contextual awareness that detects user friction points, error states, and purchase hesitation\n- Language and style adaptation system that learns from your existing content<p>Our most experimental feature: with user permission, the AI can take direct control of the DOM - clicking elements, filling forms, and guiding users through complex processes. This bypasses traditional chatbot limitations by letting the AI directly solve user problems.<p>We&#x27;d love feedback from the HN community, especially on our privacy architecture and real-time interventions.<p>For those interested in the DOM control beta please drop me an email at james@happytohelp.com", "time": 1740570320, "title": "Show HN: Encrypted visitor monitoring and intervention", "type": "story", "url": "https://happytohelp.com/"}
