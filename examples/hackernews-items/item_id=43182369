In the future, I plan to support various sources like Docker, k8s, and files to improve the local development workflow. However, it&#x27;s unlikely that Telescope will support fetching logs from remote servers via SSH, as that&#x27;s not its primary use case.", "time": 1740564348, "type": "comment"}
