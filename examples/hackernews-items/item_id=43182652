But here are other ways of accretion of code inconsistencies:<p>- Premature abstractions that are subsequently worked around around the edges.<p>- Automation built on top of wishful thinking instead of how people actually prefer to work.<p>- Inconsistent naming and file structure.<p>- Adopting many advanced or hyperspecific styles and techniques instead of leaning on more basic ones that already solve a problem.<p>I find it way easier, to go from more primitive, consistent, &quot;inlined&quot; code to more sophisticated abstractions that clearly solve emergent problems at a later point in time, than changing the direction of already factored, high level code.<p>To me it&#x27;s a matter of mental capacity and friction as well. This stuff is hard, time consuming and requires deliberate effort. I rather accept that code goes through different phases of maturity and that using and maintaining the actual programs over time, gives me a much clearer path forward than applying patterns and principles in advance on an abstract level.<p>A caveat here is that many of these inconsistency factors come from adopting third party dependencies. In my experience this is the largest chunk of liability or tech debt.<p>---<p>However, a large factor that is often overlooked in these discussions, is also organizational scale. When you have to own and understand things from A-Z you can get away with different things than if you are one part of a much larger team and vice versa.<p>I&#x27;m firmly in the former category, so I have to optimize for being able to take a much larger slice of responsibility. But I can also get away with leaving code in a more raw state for longer. I assume this balance looks different the more people you add to a project or organization.<p>I think we need to take this into consideration in these public discussions. It&#x27;s ultimately a trade off and programmers from different backgrounds will have different sensibilities.", "time": 1740568181, "type": "comment"}
