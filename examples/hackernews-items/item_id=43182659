And frankly, the menu is not in the qr-code, it is a link to the menu. What sounds appropriate here is to write also the content of the qr-code with plain letters, so one can type it, alongside the qr-code, for those who do not have a camera or whatever.<p>Now, the problem of requiring a mobile device to see the menu is a problem on its own, and while this is faciliated by having a qr-code vs having customers manually copy links on their phone (either writing them or with OCR), it is 2 separate issues for discussion. Moreover, OCR-A is not needed for any of that anywhere in the 2020s that we live.<p>The problems with QR code is that sometimes people have older smartphones or camera do not recognise them or, frankly, it being a means of obfuscating sth from humans. I have been in many situations with queues of people struggling for indeterminate reasons to scan a qr code to go fill up sth. If there was a simple link in plain text people could have even shared it between each other. Blindly trusting technology that can easily fail and is unnecessary for what one does and without redundancies is unwarranted imo.", "time": 1740568318, "type": "comment"}
