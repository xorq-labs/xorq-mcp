The only illegal content relating to sex work would be if you were actively soliciting or pimping. From the document:<p>* Causing or inciting prostitution for gain offence<p>* Controlling a prostitute for gain offence<p>Similarly, discussion of drug use wouldn&#x27;t be illegal either per se, only using the forum to buy or sell drugs or to actively encourage others to use drugs:<p>* The unlawful supply, offer to supply, of controlled drugs<p>* The unlawful supply, or offer to supply, of articles for administering or preparing controlled drugs<p>* The supply, or offer to supply, of psychoactive substances<p>* Inciting any offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971<p>That&#x27;s very different to criminalising content where you talk about being (or visiting) a prostitute, or mention past or current drug use. Those things would all still be legal content.", "time": 1740559895, "type": "comment"}
