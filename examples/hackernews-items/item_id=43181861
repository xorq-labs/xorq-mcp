Convective heat transfer is much slower. Protecting against conduction isn&#x27;t too challenging. Seeing how a spacesuit is necessary on mars building one that can retain enough heat to be comfortable isn&#x27;t really a herculean effort. Far easier than a suit for the moon, mars doesn&#x27;t really have grains of regolith that are consistently sharp and abrasive like earths moon has. On mars there&#x27;s more a fine powdery substance, it was called &quot;fines&quot; in the red mars novel.<p>It&#x27;s irritating to see people claim it&#x27;s colder than antarctica but never a discussion how the reduced atmospheric pressure makes it easier to keep warm.", "time": 1740558475, "type": "comment"}
