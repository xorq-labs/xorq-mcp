It transforms into what we call frequency space.<p>- This is most intuitive for signal analysis or images [1].<p>- Frequency space is inherently &quot;complex&quot;, i.e. represented by complex numbers.<p>- Frequencies have the advantage that they take a &quot;global&quot; view of the problem.<p>- This mechanism is <i>not</i> equivalent to the attention mechanism. There is definitely a trade-off.<p>- But it is possible that it captures many of the important relationships that attention capture.<p>- I do not have good intuition for modReLU right away, but it seems important because it modifies the frequencies but preserves the inverse Fourier transform.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk&#x2F;rbf&#x2F;HIPR2&#x2F;fourier.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk&#x2F;rbf&#x2F;HIPR2&#x2F;fourier.htm</a>", "time": 1740569123, "type": "comment"}
