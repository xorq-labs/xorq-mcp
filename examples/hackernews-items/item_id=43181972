Having a larger pool of personal will ease a lot of social friction. It&#x27;s also likely that a laser comms connection will be readily available, that is a large part of why starlink developed laser link between satellites.<p>I expect before people go that SpaceX will put a small constellation of starlink satellites in orbit of mars. I could also see them putting a bunch of probes on a starship and having them separate in martian orbit, landing at candidate sites. The combination of the 2 will lead to a lot of valuable data to decide where humans will land first.<p>Around mars it&#x27;s likely the satellites will be in a higher orbit, but there&#x27;s no internet needing low latency there either, at least not at first. They could be a basis for a mars positioning system. If a lower orbit is used they could potentially use synthetic aperture radar to get high resolution scans of the surface. It&#x27;s probable that many starships will already be waiting on the surface by the time humans make the trek out there. Presumably loaded with food, equipment parts etc... For how quickly the ships are fabricated we aren&#x27;t looking at a scenario where ships are in short supply.", "time": 1740559674, "type": "comment"}
