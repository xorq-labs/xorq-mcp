Why not?<p>The definitional trait of an event horizon is that it is <i>causally disconnected</i> from the outside universe. It is the &quot;horizon&quot; beyond which &quot;events&quot; cannot be causally connected to some observer.<p>A consequence of this is that nothing we observe on the outside can definitely tell us what&#x27;s going on inside.<p>Closest we can get is creating a complete and consistent set of laws of physics and asking those laws what happens \u2014 it&#x27;s fairly trivial to show there&#x27;s an infinite number of such laws (such a demonstration is why Occam&#x27;s Razor is even a thing), even despite the fact that right now we don&#x27;t have a single one of them.<p>&gt; Moreover, if fractal theory is right, then we are inside infinite number of black holes of increasing sizes (or other objects). But, if we are inside a black hole, why sky is black and space is cold then?<p>I don&#x27;t even know what you think you mean with &quot;fractal theory&quot;, but the reason space is black and cold is that (1) the hot surface <i>visible in every direction to the right telescopes </i> is very far away, and (2) the universe is expanding, and the combination of (1) and (2) means (3) it&#x27;s been red-shifted so hard you can&#x27;t see it with the naked eye.<p>The question of if the entire visible universe is the interior of a black hole in a bigger universe, has no apparent relationship in either direction to 1, 2 or 3.", "time": 1740563039, "type": "comment"}
