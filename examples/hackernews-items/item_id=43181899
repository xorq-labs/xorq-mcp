If you have rows of people sewing the same piece of clothing or similar, then it&#x27;s not exactly hard to track output without digital surveillance. If you have assembly lines where people perform different parts of a larger project digital surveillance is useless next to things like lean, and again, bottlenecks will show themselves extremely fast if a single station is slower than usual.<p>I suspect the purpose of these systems is actually to create a horrible work environment. Not because that is a good thing, but because it&#x27;ll drive away anyone who has other options and leave you with the most desperate people. Who will also be the cheapest people.", "time": 1740558799, "type": "comment"}
