It hallucinates, mid-quotes sources, and does not follow the formal inference logic used in research.<p>AI slop already produces many plausible-sounding articles used as infotainment and in academia. We already know this slop adds much noise to the signal and that poor signal slows actual research in both cases. But until now, the slop wasn&#x27;t masquerading specifically as research!
