Not editors with a preview pane, but straight-up viewers that render Markdown for reading.<p>There are very, very few. I use Marked 2, for Mac. I don&#x27;t even remember if I ever found another one.

Why, when there is no viewer anywhere near as ubiquitous as those for PDF... despite Markdown being much simpler and better understood?", "time": 1740560101, "type": "comment"}
