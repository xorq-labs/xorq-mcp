The humanity CAN&#x27;T live in smart cities period. We need more than 7 earths with only one inhabited to create such monsters.<p>It&#x27;s about time to understand that the new deal is only possible in small, simple and scalable solutions like homes and sheds with LITTLE infra needed to build and rebuild them. Where local water sources are enough, without needing very long aqueducts, having very large rejects, needing complex road infra etc.<p>That&#x27;s the possible high-tech future, the smart-home, smart-shed, not smart city. A digital network of desktops, homes, sheds, not some giants datacenters&#x2F;mainframes&#x2F;hubs. Try to compute and you&#x27;ll agree.", "time": 1740561940, "type": "comment"}
