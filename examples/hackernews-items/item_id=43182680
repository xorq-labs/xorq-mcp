Or would I need to setup the schema.<p>Ultimately I&#x27;m just looking for an open source alternative to firebase-&gt; while amazing, I can&#x27;t exactly claim to have an open source project that requires a closed source service.<p>Last question, Supabase heavily pushes the use of Captchas if you use any anonymous authentication. Does Gel also suggest this. Notably Firebase doesn&#x27;t care, which makes it much easier on end users.<p>Imagine having to solve a captcha to browse Amazon and add products to your cart, you&#x27;d probably just use something else.<p>Ok, just one more question! How is your SDK support. JavaScript is a given, but Godot support would be nice.", "time": 1740568701, "type": "comment"}
