Gaming at 1080p or even higher still requires thousands on GPUs which I&#x27;m not willing to do. However simply having more than 1080p for desktop usage is accessible and has been so for over 10 years. A 4k monitor costs a fraction of what a gaming GPU costs. My desktop iGPU from 2014 has zero problems driving 2x4k. It also does so with the system consuming less than 60W from the wall at usage (lower than some laptop CPUs do these days).<p>If you want to play the useless popularity game, go and check what are the resolutions on the phones and tablets   with even smaller screens sold in the last 10 years (which exceeds the number of laptops by far), and even friggin&#x27; eink notepads.<p>&quot;The fact&quot; is people today would never accept sub-retina dpis even for cheap phones, and the market has clearly spoken. &quot;The fact&quot; is your arguments about human perception are utter bullshit (as trivially disproven as todays arguments about 60fps), and remind me of the discussions I had when forced to use 60fps 800x600 TN screens (pure hell on earth) after having used 1280 at 90hz for ages with CRTs, all in the name of &quot;progress&quot;.", "time": 1740558613, "type": "comment"}
