But since the knowledge is distilled and condensed then there&#x27;s less opportunities to mess it up, compared to the alternative of &quot;doing my own research&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s controversial for you. That&#x27;s how science works. You read what other people wrote first. Then you try to make some contribution if you are so inclined.", "time": 1740568253, "type": "comment"}
