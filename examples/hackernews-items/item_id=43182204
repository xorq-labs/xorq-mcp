He&#x27;d call up some person, pretend to be in some other department within their organization, and ask them for some specific bit of information he needed to further his attack (or ask them to change some specific thing that would allow him to further his attack).<p>Would knowing the structure of Illinois governmental organizations help someone perform social engineering attacks against them?  Yes, absolutely.<p>Should Illinois therefore keep the internal structures of their organizations -- the department names and the officials who run them -- secret?  No, absolutely not.<p>First of all, if an attacker doesn&#x27;t know them, they&#x27;ll just use <i>other</i> social engineering attacks to figure them out; i.e., hiding the structure doesn&#x27;t stop social engineering attacks, it just slows them down.  Secondly, the value to the <i>public</i> of being able to navigate governmental structures far outweighs the cost of potential attacks.<p>This seems to me to be a direct analog: The &quot;organizational structure&quot; is the &quot;database schema&quot;, and the &quot;willingness to help a random person on the phone who seems to know what they&#x27;re talking about&quot; is the &quot;SQL injection vulnerability&quot;.  If an attacker knows the schema, their job is faster; but if they don&#x27;t know the schema, they&#x27;ll just use attacks to figure out the schema; so keeping it private doesn&#x27;t stop an attack, only slow it down.  And the benefit to the public of being able to issue FOIA requests far outweighs the cost of potential attacks.", "time": 1740562304, "type": "comment"}
