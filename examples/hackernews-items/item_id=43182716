Our main finding was that o3 mini especially is great on paper but surprisingly hard to prompt, compared to non reasoning models. \nI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem with reasoning, but rather with this specific model. \nI also suspect that o3 mini is a rather small model and so it can lack useful knowledge for broad applications.\nEspecially for RAG, it seems that larger and fast models (e.g. gpt4o) perform better as of today.", "time": 1740569291, "type": "comment"}
