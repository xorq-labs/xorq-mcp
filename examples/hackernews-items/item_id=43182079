Maybe it\u2019s p-hacking, journals that focus entirely on publishing novel research over replication (and grant funders that act similarly), refusals to share data and methodological details&#x2F;process transparency, etc that apply to all fields.<p>[1] DOI: 10.1126&#x2F;science.aac4716\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41562-018-0399-z\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41562-018-0399-z</a>\n[3]10.1136&#x2F;bmj.e2555\n[4]10.1038&#x2F;nrd3439-c1\n[5]10.1038&#x2F;s41562-024-02062-9", "time": 1740560843, "type": "comment"}
