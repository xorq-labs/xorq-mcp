I installed yesterday expecting I will loose my time since it\u2019s made by Google (how far have they fallen, I remember being so excited about gmail in 2005). And ho boy, you can\u2019t even drag and drop files from your ide in the chat to add them into the context. Basic features that we now take for granted are lacking. I uninstalled right away, don\u2019t know why I fell for it once more.<p>Why is Google in that state? What happened?<p>They have to give their product for free and it\u2019s so bad that even for free it seems nobody wants them. During that time you have company like Cursor that are super popular and charge for their service. Anthropic their servers are melting under the load and they charge top dollar for it.<p>If this came out 2 or 3 years ago, that would have been good.", "time": 1740563343, "type": "comment"}
