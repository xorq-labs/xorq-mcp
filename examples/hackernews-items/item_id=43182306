Because &quot;human languages&quot; lack the precision to describe such a spec. This is exactly why programming languages exist in the first place: a language that humans understand but that allow for precise and unambiguous specifications and&#x2F;or instructions. Do note that a computer cannot execute &quot;Python&quot; or &quot;C&quot;. We needs to translate it first (compiling). Edit: A programmer doens&#x27;t just type curly brackets and semi-colons in the right place, she takes vague and ambigous specs and makes them precise enough so that machines can repeat them.<p>As a kid we had this joke (works better in Dutch).<p>John gets in an accident, looses both his arms. A doctor gives him futuristic voice-controlled prostethics.<p>John: &quot;Pick up coffee-mug&quot;. &quot;Bring to mouth to drink&quot;. woa! impressed he goes home.<p>John, all excited &quot;unzip pants&quot;, &quot;grab d#ck&quot;, &quot;jerk off&quot;<p>(in Dutch, trek af means both &quot;rip off&quot; and &quot;w#ank&quot;)<p>Jokes aside, we do have such a language that&#x27;s not a programming language in the common sense: executable specs - end to end tests. Gherkin being a famous one but certainly not the only one. BDD, where the B is described by humans, in a DSL and the DD is performed by AI. I could imagine this working. Not currently and not anywhere soon (current LLMs are great at making new stuff, horrible at changing existing stuff), but it might work.<p>We&#x27;d then end up with just another programming language, but one thats more accessible to more people, I guess. And the AI is &quot;just a compiler&quot; in that sense.", "time": 1740563555, "type": "comment"}
