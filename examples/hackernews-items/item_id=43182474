The issue is what these platforms are required to censor <i>on behalf</i> of these other laws.<p>Recall that we just spent several years where discussion of major political issues of concern to society were censored across social media platforms. Taking an extremely charitable interpretation of what government demands will be made here isn&#x27;t merely na\u00efve but empirically false.<p>And the reason I chose those kinds of illegal activities was to show that these very laws themselves are plausibly oppressive as-is, plausibly lacking in &quot;deep democractic&quot; support (ie., perhaps suriving on very thin majorities) -- and so on.<p>And yet it is these laws for which mass interactive media will be censored.<p>This is hardly a list with murder at the top.", "time": 1740565664, "type": "comment"}
