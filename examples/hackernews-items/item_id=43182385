The moment I realized something was different in me was left pad, I already felt that couldn&#x27;t be me.<p>The log4j incident hit me different, it COULD have easily been me. A security vulnerability is like death or a terminal illness in my eyes. Successful companies that scale do so without incidents, If you are running a company and you have a vuln you are out of the race. So I tightened up a lot after that.<p>I realize something similar with sex I just can&#x27;t fathom putting my whole life on the line just to have sex with somebody and then have nothing to show for it, no relationship, nothing.<p>And today we see this, people are really risking their companies, their reputation, their pride to have pretty colors on their IDE.<p>I used to fight it, try to convince people, of course I still keep the pride of being different and weary, but in the end, you will likely be fine, and I only hold a statistical advantage, both are valid strategies of going about life I guess.", "time": 1740564594, "type": "comment"}
