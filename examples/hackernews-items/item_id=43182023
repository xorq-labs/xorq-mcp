If we were to artificially prevent technology from advancing, wouldn&#x27;t that just be speedrunning its collapse, even though we aren&#x27;t even sure it would have otherwise collapsed?<p>Also, what&#x27;s the relationship between technology and capitalism, here?  I understand that there&#x27;s a strongly positive correlation between how free a market is and the rate of technological advancement for participants in that market, and that capitalist governments allow free markets, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that a technological collapse would lead to government collapse.", "time": 1740560173, "type": "comment"}
