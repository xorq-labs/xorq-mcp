Notably though that doesn&#x27;t give you any sort of relative or absolute offset. Neither does it have anything to say about, for example, blocks of different types which might be interleaved. Or compression. Or indexes. Or copy on write related garbage collection. Or journaling. Or any number of other things.<p>Now if you wanted to argue that a schema serves the same purpose as a file layout, ie that it&#x27;s how a programmer interfaces with the data, and that it impacts workload performance, that would be fair enough. And given that laws are all about intent perhaps that would be relevant. (Or perhaps not. I didn&#x27;t read about the case yet.)<p>But I think it&#x27;s fairly reasonable to say that in typical usage an SQL schema is decidedly not a file layout in a literal sense.", "time": 1740565567, "type": "comment"}
