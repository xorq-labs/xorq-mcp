There&#x27;s good workers and there&#x27;s bad workers, but the old adage &quot;they don&#x27;t build it like they used to&quot; is often baloney. The quality of most building products (including windows) is much higher today compared to, say, 50 years ago, and as you&#x27;ve probably experienced yourself during your reno, it&#x27;s not like the quality of work was especially high in the olden days. Less skilled workers without much pride in their craft have always cut corners and done shabby jobs, then and now.<p>But there definitely are good craftsmen out there, and generally the education they receive today is much higher than one or two generations ago. But, unfortunately, it&#x27;s true that &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;, which makes high quality work often pretty much unaffordable for many. That&#x27;s the big reason I&#x27;m getting myself dirty at our house every day.<p>There are some jobs that I can do at least as good as hired labor, if not better, but there are other jobs where a qualified worker will give me a better result in the end.
