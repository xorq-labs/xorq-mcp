Digs like \u201cthe wrongness of your statement\u201d are definitely far on relevant spectrum.<p>Therefore, I believe the rules against name-calling are not literal. As you noticed, attempting to restrict discussion more strictly would make it bland, but on the other hand when it comes to literal name-calling in a civilized discussion it\u2019s way past all limits.<p>Tangentially, I was surprised to learn recently that merely the use of specific \u201cyou\u201d in an argument is already considered unnecessary and perceived as somewhat confrontational. Haven\u2019t confirmed it from multiple sources (not sure how to search for), but in hindsight it makes sense: the mood changes, and the argument can quickly devolve thereafter. I suspect it might be something from psychotherapy practice.", "time": 1740559654, "type": "comment"}
